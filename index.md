<h2 class="h2-color"  style="margin-bottom:4px">Professional Experience</h2>
<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px">Senior Software Engineer, bKash ltd. [Jan'23 to Present]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">At bKash, I worked on several key products, each contributing significantly to the company's success. One of my primary focuses is the 'Pay Bill' service, one of the most heavily trafficked services. I worked to ensure its performance, seamless functionality and enhance its revenue-generating potential.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, I worked on the Identity Management System, the path to a more streamlined and user-friendly experience. I have also completed a groundbreaking prototype for generating PDFs most recently. This new approach boasts a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed, all while utilizing the same resources as the previous method.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, recognizing the need for a more tailored solution, I took the initiative to create an in-house adapter for development purposes. This strategic move allowed us to exercise greater control over the development process and provided a cost-effective alternative to third-party services. I also helped with taking interviews and hiring.</p>



<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px">Lead Backend Engineer, Hash Solution Ltd. [Jan'23 to July'23]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">At Hash Solutions, I played a pivotal role in shaping the technical landscape. I took the lead in designing the backend microservices architecture, laying a robust foundation for our systems. From there, I built the core backend service, starting from scratch and bringing it to fruition.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
One of my significant contributions was designing and developing the core authentication and dashboard modules, integral components that added depth and functionality to our systems.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to my technical contributions, I led the backend team and regularly conducted sprint planning, code reviews, and internal technical troubleshooting. Additionally, I took an active role in the hiring process, identifying and onboarding top talent to strengthen our team and elevate our capabilities.</p>




<h3 class="h2-color"  style="margin-bottom:4px;">Software Engineer, SELISE Digital Platforms. [Aug'19 to Dec'22]</h3> 
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">At SELISE, I engaged in research and development and comprehensive full-stack application development. I conducted technical requirement analyses and participated in sprint and release planning for project execution. Additionally, I served as an internal technical consultant for cross-team projects.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
One of my notable accomplishments was the substantial improvement in service performance, achieving a remarkable 30% boost. I was also deeply involved in pioneering R&D efforts to introduce novel services and features in the backend microservices. In addition to this, I also played a pivotal role in enhancing developer productivity by introducing tracing-based logging for microservices instead of file-based logging.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify;">
I also led a dedicated team, delivering several projects and enhancing our identity management system. Improving the IMS allowed us to onboard users using new SSO methods and securely exchange tokens.</p>
