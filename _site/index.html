      <h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px;"> About Me</h2>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify">I design and build scaleable, distributed and production ready software solutions that provides solutions to real world problems for millions of users. I can manage and work with cross functional teams.
<br /><br />
I actively participate in research for new products and methodologies to improve the quality and performance of our software solutions.
 </p>

<h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px"> Research Interests </h2>

<h2 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px">Professional Experience</h2>
<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px">Senior Software Engineer, bKash ltd. [Jan'23 to Present]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">At bKash, I worked on several key products. One of my primary focuses is the 'Pay Bill' service, one of the most heavily trafficked services. I converted several modules of pay bill service to reactive Java implementation to enhance its performance and capacity while using the same resource.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Furthermore, I worked on the Identity Management System, the path to a more streamlined and user-friendly experience, and helped introduce a new method of signing up as a customer. I have also completed a  prototype for generating PDFs most recently. This new approach boasts a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed, all while utilizing the same resources as the previous method. It will help us to reduce the time for blocking IO operations and create a smoother user experience.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify;">
Additionally, recognizing the need for a more tailored solution, I took the initiative to create an in-house adapter for development purposes. This adapter allowed us to exercise greater control over the development process and provided a cost-effective alternative to third-party services. I also actively helped with taking interviews and hiring.</p>

<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px">Lead Backend Engineer, Hash Solution Ltd. [Jan'23 to July'23]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">At Hash Solutions, I led the design of the backend microservices architecture, both web and hosted services. From there, I built the core backend service interfaces for inter-service communication and shared functionalities.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Additionally, I  developed the core authentication and authorization module to protect the services from unwanted access. I created a dashboard module for the admin to support customers and configure the software. I also integrated Stripe as a payment method, which offers a smooth user experience.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to my technical contributions, I led a backend team and regularly conducted sprint planning, code reviews, and internal technical troubleshooting. Aside from that, I took an active role in the hiring process and training the new joiners.</p>

<h3 class="h2-color" style="margin-bottom:4px;">Software Engineer, SELISE Digital Platforms. [Aug'19 to Dec'22]</h3>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">At SELISE, I was a full-stack software developer. I built reusable front-end modules and updated several projects to the latest release of the end framework. I developed a distributed computing for a client's heavily loaded matching algorithm to improve performance. Additionally, I served as an internal technical consultant for cross-team projects.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="margin-bottom:8px; text-align: justify;">
Aside from that, I worked on the suite of core microservices. I introduced caching and message-based communication for hosted services to improve their performance. I also developed novel services and features in the backend microservices. In addition to this, I built a package using openTelemetry to enhance developer productivity by introducing tracing-based logging for microservices instead of file-based logging.</p>
<p class="par-color" style="text-align: justify;">
I also led a team, conducting requirement analysis, sprint planning, code reviewing, and successfully delivering several projects. I solved an issue for long tokens generated by the identity management system with dynamic role management. In addition to that, I introduced new methods to onboard users using SSO methods and securely exchange tokens.</p>
